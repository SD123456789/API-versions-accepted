## Installation

After installing python3 and pip3 on your operating system of choice, please run the following command in the directory containing the requirements.txt file so that necessary dependencies can be installed:

## Configuration

No configuration possible. This script is a simple GET request for the accepted API versions.


## Usage

There is only one input (first command line argument) which is an IP address.
The accepted API versions are the output.
This script can be executed on any platform that has python3 installed and the requests plugin installed.

To run the script use one of the following methods:
`./apiGET.py <IP address of server>`
`python3 apiGET.py <IP address of server>`
